# Hybrid Recommendation System
•Designed and implemented a movie and TV show
recommendation system using Hybrid recommendation
model.
•It comines both Neural Collaborative Filtering and
Similarity based Content recommendation using
weighted average of their predictions.
•Implemented on the MovieLens 100k dataset along with
TMDB movie Descriptions.
•Calculated NDCG@10 of 0.69, Precision@k of 0.47,
Recall@k of 0.27 for test set.
•Deployed the Hybrid Model using Fast API to recommend
top 10 movies to each user and similar movies to new
users.
•Also implemented endpoint for A/B testing using T-test
statistic using user feedback.
